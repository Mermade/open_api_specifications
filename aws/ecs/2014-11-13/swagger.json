    "description": "<p>Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances. Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-enabled applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features like security groups, Amazon EBS volumes, and IAM roles.</p> <p>You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Modifies the desired count, deployment configuration, or task definition used in a service.</p> <p>You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new <code>desiredCount</code> parameter.</p> <p>You can use <a>UpdateService</a> to modify your task definition and deploy a new version of your service.</p> <p>You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> and <code>maximumPercent</code>, to determine the deployment strategy.</p> <p>If the <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore the <code>desiredCount</code> temporarily during a deployment. For example, if your service has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks, a <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state; tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance it is hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.</p> <p>The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks, a <code>maximumPercent</code> value of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).</p> <p>When <a>UpdateService</a> stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of <code>docker stop</code> is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a <code>SIGTERM</code> and a 30-second timeout, after which <code>SIGKILL</code> is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the <code>SIGTERM</code> gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no <code>SIGKILL</code> is sent.</p> <p>When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it attempts to balance them across the Availability Zones in your cluster with the following logic:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).</p> </li> <li> <p>Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.</p> </li> </ul>",

          "description": "<p>The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are <code>none</code>, <code>bridge</code>, and <code>host</code>. </p> <p>The default Docker network mode is <code>bridge</code>. If the network mode is set to <code>none</code>, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the task's containers do not have external connectivity. The <code>host</code> network mode offers the highest networking performance for containers because they use the host network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the <code>bridge</code> mode; however, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port, so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings or run multiple instantiations of the same task on a single container instance if port mappings are used.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-settings\">Network settings</a> in the <i>Docker run reference</i>.</p>"
